# Hello world

The most basic app you can make with Capy are lines required for Capy to work. For example:
```zig title="src/main.zig"
const capy = @import("capy");
pub usingnamespace capy.cross_platform;

pub fn main() !void {
    try capy.init();
}
```
The use of `pub usingnamespace capy.cross_platform;` is useful for making your GUI work on some
platform with different ways of workings, like WebAssembly

Using `capy.init()` initializes capy. This is necessary on all platforms. Otherwise, Capy *will*
crash.

To execute the app, you have to type the following command
```sh
zig build run
```

## Creating a window

It might be interesting for the program to actually do something, like displaying a window

For that, you can inititialize a window, set its size and display it.
```zig title="src/main.zig"
const capy = @import("capy");
pub usingnamespace capy.cross_platform;

pub fn main() !void {
	try capy.init();
	
	var window = try capy.Window.init();
	window.setPreferredSize(800, 600);
	window.show();
	capy.runEventLoop();
}
```

Running this shows an empty window.

Notice that we added a call to the function `capy.runEventLoop()`. You need to use it in order to
start the event loop, which lets the app listen to the OS and avoids having an unresponsive window.

## Adding a button

This is nice, but an empty window is as useful as an unwearable shoe. Adding a button seems like the next logical step.  
For that, we can use the `window.set()` function and the [`Button`](https://capy-ui.org/api-reference/#capy.components.Button.Button) widget to see how to initialize a widget.

First, in `capy` you create a widget using a function. So for a button, we would use `Button( something here )`.
Widgets are configured using a single struct that is always placed first. For now, we will only use the `label` field.

This means we can easily have a labelled button `Button(.{ .label = "A Button" })`. Then we just need to put that button as argument to the `try window.set(anywidget)` function.

:::note

In the documentation, `anywidget`, which is implemented using `anytype`, refers to any widget
constructed with their function or the [Widget](https://capy-ui.org/api-reference/#capy.widget.Widget) type.

:::

So let's set `capy.button(.{ .label = "A Button" })` as our window's widget:
```zig title="src/main.zig"
const capy = @import("capy");
pub usingnamespace capy.cross_platform;

pub fn main() !void {
	window.setPreferredSize(800, 600);
	try window.set(
    	capy.button(.{ .label = "A Button" })
	);
	window.show();
}
```

To know how to use Capy to make more things, you can look at the [available examples](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy/tree/master/examples) which feature animations ([colors.zig](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy/blob/master/examples/colors.zig)), custom components ([graph.zig](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy/blob/master/examples/graph.zig)), and a [simple calculator](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy/blob/master/examples/calculator.zig).
