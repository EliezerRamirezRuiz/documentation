# Signing your application

## Desktop

### On Windows
You can [submit your final executable for malware analysis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission),
provided you have enough users (about a hundred or more) this should be enough to remove the
Windows SmartScreen protection entirely free of charge.

Otherwise, you will need to **buy** a certificate from Microsoft.

### On macOS
For distribution on the App Store, you must **subscribe** to Apple Developer Account.

Otherwise, to distribute it online, you need to sign the application.

### On Linux
You don't need to do anything.

## Mobile

### On Android
Verification is done by submitting the application to the Google Play Store.
Distributing APKs in any other way will by default be untrusted and require additional
user manipulation (overriding Play Protect) to install.

### On iOS
**Subscribe** to Apple Developer Account
